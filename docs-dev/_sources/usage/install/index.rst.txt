GenUI Installation Guide
========================

In this guide, you will learn how to setup and deploy a GenUI backend server
for both production and development. After installation, we recommend that
you carefully study the REST API documentation available at
the URL: :code:`{your_host}/api/`. This will help you understand the
GenUI data structures and following the :ref:`developer guide <dev-guide-index>`
should then be easier.
