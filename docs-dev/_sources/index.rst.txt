   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GenUI's documentation!
=================================

This is the documentation of the GenUI backend framework. GenUI is a
collection of web applications implemented with `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and
`Django REST <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_. This documentation describes the Python API of the `genui`
package, which is open source and `available on GitHub <https://github.com/martin-sicho/genui>`_.
However, we also provide a frontend GUI application
available from `here <https://github.com/martin-sicho/genui-gui>`_. You can deploy frontend, backend
and background workers easily with Docker images and Docker Compose (see :ref:`install-guide-docker`).

.. note:: Currently we are using Django 2.2 as it was the most stable version at the time of starting this project, but we will begin the move to Django 3.x soon.
